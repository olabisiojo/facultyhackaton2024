# Project Description.
The revised General Bioinformatics Course offers a comprehensive and hands-on approach to modern bioinformatics, with a strong emphasis on high-performance computing (HPC) applications. This course integrates fundamental bioinformatics concepts with practical HPC skills, providing students with a solid foundation in both areas. The curriculum begins with an introduction to basic programming, coding, and HPC concepts, including access to scientific gateways and bash scripting. As the course progresses, it delves into advanced topics such as large-scale genomic data analysis, structural bioinformatics, HPC-based visualization of biological datasets, and HPC-enabled comparative genomics. Students will gain practical experience through project-based modules, utilizing a local supercomputer setup for hands-on learning. The course culminates in a final exam structured as an HPC-based project, allowing students to apply their acquired knowledge in a real-world scenario. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills in HPC and bioinformatics, this course prepares students for the computational challenges of modern biological research and equips them with valuable tools for data-intensive scientific discovery.

Attendance at the SGX3 Gateway Conference 2024
Bozeman, MT
OCT 8 – 10, 2024

SGX3 Gateway Conference 2024 was an eventful workshop. From registration at the conference to the very closing session, all participants were thoroughly impacted.
The following tells some of the story of the events:

### 1. Dr Olamide Tawose (Faculty Participant from Lincoln University of Pennsylvania), having just left the registration stand, excited, made progress into the Conference Hall.
